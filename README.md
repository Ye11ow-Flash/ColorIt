# ColorIt

	Colorises Black & white photo automatically using deep learning. 
	
## Getting Started

	Clone this github which includes model.h5 & all other .py files in one folder.

## Prerequisites

	Install Python 3.6 
	Install tensorflow, keras, PyQt4, scikit-image

## Installing

	Download python 3.6
	Download pyqt4
	Install python
	then,
		use following commands to install the libraries
		$ pip install tensorflow
		$ pip install keras
		$ pip install scikit-image
		
## Getting Dataset and trained model file
	The Train and Test data files are available on the following link.
	https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ttSWCJGWZdGLeTHRzHHVxuAhJUF7c5An?usp=sharing

## Running the tests

	Once setup is ready,
		Execute Prediction.py
		Double click on ColorIt.py
		
	- Click on the "HOME" button
	- Click on the "Select a file from computer" button
	- Once file is uploaded, click on "Colorise" button
	- Result will be saved in a folder on desktop

## Train

	This model is trained on Google Colab GPU.
	This software was trained on 1000 image dataset and we got pretty good results but we can further train it on more images to improvise the results.

## Built With

	- Python 3
	- pyQt4
	- CNN using keras
